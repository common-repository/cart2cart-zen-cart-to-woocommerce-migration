=Can I migrate my orders without customers?=
Cart2Cart doesn't allow to migrate Orders without Customers, because these data are connected. 

=Will my Zen Cart store function during the migration?=
The actual migration process will not influence the speed of your current store performance.
As an exception, you might experience website performance slowdown for one of the following reasons that Cart2Cart is not capable either to control or prevent:
- the amount of products exceeds memory limit of your hosting plan;
- wide range of third-party modules;
- etc.

= What is order statuses mapping? =
Cart2Cart enables you  to map order statuses on Zen Cart with the corresponding ones on WooCommerce. Order status mapping helps to migrate the order data properly.
Order statuses have to be created by store owner on target WooCommerce shopping cart, so that they were shown on Migration Wizard when the migration is set. Create order statuses on WooCommerce store from Admin panel and map them on the order statuses mapping field of Migration Wizard to have orders migrated properly.
